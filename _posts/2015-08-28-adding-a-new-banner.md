- In the Magento admin section, navigate to _Banner Slider > Manage Banners_
- Enter a **Title** to identify this slide
- Upload an image with **Choose File**
- (optional) Enter **Link URL**, eg _/sale_ or _https://inside.com.au/shop_
- (optional) **Call to Action Text** is the button text
- Ensure **Status** is Enabled
- (optional) **Description** is displayed as small writing above the **Title** on the slide

When all is done, it might look something like this:

![Banners](/assets/img/banner-slider/add-banner.png)

- Click **Save Banner**

Repeat to upload more banners, or [proceed to create a slider]({% post_url 2015-08-28-adding-a-new-banner-slider %})


## A note about image size

- Upload images that are at least 1024 pixels wide, but try to keep them less than 1MB in file size
- It's best to upload all of the images that you intend to use in the same slider as exact same dimensions
- The slider automatically resizes all of its images to fill 100% of the width available to them
